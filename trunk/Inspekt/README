PLEASE NOTE: Inspekt is early in development, and the API should not be considered stable.


### WHAT IS INSPEKT?
Inspekt is a comprehensive filtering and validation library for PHP4 and PHP5.

Development of Inspekt is funded by OWASP's Spring of Code 2007.

### HOW DO I USE INSPEKT? Check the user docs at
http://funkatron.com/inspekt/user_docs or the API docs at
http://funkatron.com/inspekt/api_docs


### THIS LOOKS A LOT LIKE THE OLD ZEND_FILTER COMPONENT FROM THE ZEND FRAMEWORK
That's because it is. Zend_Filter_Input from ZFW v0.7 forms the basis for
Inspekt.


### HOW CAN I CONTRIBUTE, OFFER FEEDBACK, REPORT BUGS, COMPLAIN, ETC.?
